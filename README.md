# the best dotfiles on the internet

## Scripts

#### init-dotfiles

Set up dotfile config entry points, linking into this dotfile repo

#### tmux-session

Start a tmux session for a workspace directory, yoinked and modified from ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles

Searches ~/workspace for directories containing git repos

## Neovim

Mostly because it looks cool. Have had lots of slow configurations in the past, hoping to keep this one zippy.

Lazy package manager self explanatory.

TreeSitter and LSP support for Rust, Go, TypeScript, Docker, Markdown, Tailwind, Terraform, JSON, YAML.

## Zsh

Zsh because Cook said so. Plus oh-my-zsh because adding bloat to your shell _should_ be easy.

## Tmux

The Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics holds that there are many worlds which exist in parallel at the same space and time as our own. It's like this but for shells.
